A PHP class that lets you work with DICOM tags, convert to jpg, compress, uncompress, receive, and send images.

Originally a fork of http://www.deanvaughan.org/projects/class_dicom_php/.

The original author's aim was to keep the interface as simple as possible while at the same time providing a class that would be easy to grow.
